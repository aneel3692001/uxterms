# UxTerms Overhaul - Phase 7 Complete (Project Restructure)

## ✅ COMPLETED IN THIS PHASE

### 1. Data Extraction
Extracted hardcoded data from components into a centralized `src/data` directory:
- `testimonials.ts`
- `faq.ts`
- `metrics.ts`
- `skill-progression.ts`
- `how-it-works.ts`
- `curriculum.ts` (from What You Learn)
- `resources.ts` (from Tools & Resources)
- `differentiators.ts`

### 2. Component Refactoring
Updated all homepage section components to import data from `src/data`. This improves maintainability and separation of concerns.

## ⚠️ REMAINING WORK

**PART 4 - Global UI Fixes** (~30 mins)
- [ ] Verify spacing across other pages
- [ ] Remove any remaining hardcoded values

**PART 10 - Color Cleanup** (~30 mins)
- [ ] Final sweep for non-palette colors (e.g., `bg-blue-500`, `text-green-600`)

**PART 11 - Accessibility** (~30 mins)
- [ ] Final accessibility check

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

I recommend proceeding with **Part 10 (Color Cleanup)** to ensure strict adherence to the new design system.
